# FolioPrime

FolioPrime is a household-level portfolio modeling and asset allocation platform.

The platform aggregates investment accounts (taxable brokerage, IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, 403b, etc.) and provides:

- Household portfolio visualization
- Asset allocation modeling
- Tax-aware asset placement guidance
- Drift monitoring
- Security duplication detection

FolioPrime does NOT:
- Custody assets
- Initiate payments
- Execute trades
- Move funds
- Provide investment advisory services

It is strictly an analytics and decision-support platform.
